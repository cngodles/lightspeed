	<h1>The Speed of Light</h1>
	<p><i>In Real Time.</i></p>
  <p>Light is fast. It travels 229,792 km (or 299,792,458 m) every second, or 186,282 miles per second. But space is also large. 
    Our own galaxy would take 200,000 years to cross at the speed of light. Once a photon leaves the Sun, on average it will take more than 4 hours
  to cross the orbit of Nepture. Click the button below to run a simulated journey of a beam of light as it leaves the Sun and crosses the Solar System.</p>

   	"The extreme pressure and temperatures in Neptune's interior give rise to exotic forms of ice, such as 'hot ice' and 'superionic ice'.",

    facts:[
    "Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the outer solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune.",
    "It was discovered on February 18, 1930, by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.",
    "Pluto was considered the ninth planet in our solar system until its reclassification as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006.",
    "The decision to reclassify Pluto was based on new criteria for what constitutes a planet, including the requirement that a planet must have cleared its orbit of other debris.",
    "Pluto has a highly elliptical orbit that takes it closer to the Sun than Neptune for about 20 years of its 248-year orbital period.",
    "Its distance from the Sun varies between about 4.4 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) at perihelion to about 7.4 billion kilometers (4.6 billion miles) at aphelion.",
    "Pluto has a diameter of approximately 2,377 kilometers (1,476 miles), making it smaller than Earth's Moon.",
    "It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide.",
    "The surface of Pluto is covered in a variety of icy materials, including nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, as well as water ice.",
    "Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Charon is the largest and closest moon to Pluto, with a diameter about half that of Pluto's.",
    "Charon is tidally locked with Pluto, meaning the same side always faces the planet.",
    "Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because their center of mass is outside either body.",
    "Pluto's surface features include mountains, valleys, plains, and possibly cryovolcanoes—volcanoes that erupt icy materials instead of molten rock.",
    "The New Horizons spacecraft, launched by NASA in 2006, made a flyby of Pluto in July 2015, providing the first close-up images and data of the dwarf planet.",
    "New Horizons revealed diverse surface features on Pluto, including a heart-shaped region informally named Tombaugh Regio.",
    "Pluto's orbit is influenced by the gravitational pull of Neptune, leading to a phenomenon called orbital resonance.",
    "Despite being classified as a dwarf planet, Pluto remains of great interest to scientists, as it offers insights into the outer solar system and the processes that shaped its formation.",
    "Pluto's surface temperature can drop to as low as -240 degrees Celsius (-400 degrees Fahrenheit), making it one of the coldest places in the solar system.",
    "Pluto's atmosphere can freeze and collapse as it moves farther from the Sun during its orbit.",
    "The discovery of Pluto was partially motivated by predictions of an unknown ninth planet influencing the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.",
    "Pluto's orbit is inclined relative to the plane of the solar system, and it is also more eccentric than the orbits of the eight major planets.",
    "Pluto's orbit is so elliptical that at times, it comes closer to the Sun than Neptune. This happened most recently between 1979 and 1999.",
    "The name 'Pluto' was suggested by Venetia Burney, an eleven-year-old schoolgirl from Oxford, England. It was chosen in part because it starts with the initials of Percival Lowell, the founder of the Lowell Observatory.",
    "Pluto's status as a planet or dwarf planet continues to be debated among astronomers and planetary scientists, reflecting ongoing discussions about how to classify celestial bodies in our solar system.",
    "Studying Pluto provides valuable insights into the history and evolution of the solar system, as well as the diversity of worlds that exist beyond the realm of the major planets.",
    "Pluto's orbit takes approximately 248 Earth years to complete one trip around the Sun.",
    "Pluto was initially thought to be much larger than its actual size. This was due to incorrect estimates of its mass based on irregularities in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.",
    "Pluto's discovery was the result of a systematic search for a ninth planet beyond the orbit of Neptune, prompted by irregularities in the orbit of Uranus.",
    "Pluto's orbit is highly inclined relative to the plane of the solar system, with an inclination of about 17 degrees.",
    "Pluto's eccentric orbit sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, as it did from 1979 to 1999.",
    "Pluto's orbit is not perfectly circular, leading to variations in its distance from the Sun during its orbital period.",
    "Pluto has a reddish tint to its surface, possibly due to the presence of tholins—complex organic molecules formed by the interaction of sunlight with methane and nitrogen in its atmosphere.",
    "Pluto's largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978 by James Christy and Robert Harrington at the United States Naval Observatory.",
    "Charon is about half the size of Pluto and is the largest moon relative to its parent body in the solar system.",
    "Charon's orbit is nearly circular and is tidally locked with Pluto, meaning the same side always faces the planet.",
    "Charon's surface is characterized by impact craters, valleys, and a dark region named Mordor Macula.",
    "Pluto's other moons—Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra—were discovered using the Hubble Space Telescope between 2005 and 2012.",
    "Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra are much smaller than Charon and have irregular shapes.",
    "The discovery of Pluto's moons provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the Pluto-Charon system.",
    "Pluto and Charon orbit a common center of mass located outside Pluto's surface, making them a binary system.",
    "The New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015, providing unprecedented images and data of the dwarf planet and its moons.",
    "New Horizons captured detailed images of Pluto's surface features, including mountains, valleys, plains, and ice formations.",
    "The flyby of Pluto by New Horizons marked the first time a spacecraft had visited the dwarf planet.",
    "New Horizons also studied Pluto's atmosphere, revealing its composition and dynamics.",
    "Pluto's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.",
    "Pluto's atmosphere extends to altitudes of about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) above its surface.",
    "Pluto's atmosphere undergoes seasonal changes as the dwarf planet moves along its highly elliptical orbit.",
    "Pluto's atmosphere freezes and collapses as it moves farther from the Sun during its orbit, leading to changes in surface pressure and temperature.",
    "Pluto's surface features include mountains, valleys, and plains, as well as possible cryovolcanoes—volcanoes that erupt icy materials instead of molten rock.",
    "Pluto's surface is covered in a variety of icy materials, including nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, as well as water ice."
