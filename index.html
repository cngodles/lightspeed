	<h1>The Speed of Light</h1>
	<p><i>In Real Time.</i></p>
  <p>Light is fast. It travels 229,792 km (or 299,792,458 m) every second, or 186,282 miles per second. But space is also large. 
    Our own galaxy would take 200,000 years to cross at the speed of light. Once a photon leaves the Sun, on average it will take more than 4 hours
  to cross the orbit of Nepture. Click the button below to run a simulated journey of a beam of light as it leaves the Sun and crosses the Solar System.</p>

	"Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, passing by the planet in 1986 and providing valuable data and images of its atmosphere, rings, and moons.",
	"Uranus has a pale blue-green coloration in its atmosphere due to the presence of methane gas, which absorbs red light and reflects blue and green wavelengths.",
	"The extreme temperatures on Uranus can reach as low as -224 degrees Celsius (-371 degrees Fahrenheit) in its upper atmosphere.",
	"The interior of Uranus is believed to consist of a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of icy materials and an outer layer of hydrogen and helium gases.",
